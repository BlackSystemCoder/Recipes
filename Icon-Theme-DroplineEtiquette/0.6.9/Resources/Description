[Description]
In the authors words:

Dropline Etiquette is Dropline GNOMEs default icon set. Is part of 
the Fun theme. Originally made by Andy Fitzsimon, I recolored all 
of the icons, made new compositions and even created lots from 
scratch. Development on this icon set is almost dead, i still have 
some plans before killing it.
