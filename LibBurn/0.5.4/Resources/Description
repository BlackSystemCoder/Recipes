[Summary] A library by which preformatted data get onto optical media 
[Description] libburn a library by which preformatted data get onto optical media.
It uses either /dev/sgN (e.g. on kernel 2.4 with ide-scsi) or
/dev/srM or /dev/hdX (e.g. on kernel 2.6).
libburn is the foundation of cdrecord emulation. Its code is
independent of cdrecord. Its DVD capabilities are learned from
studying the code of dvd+rw-tools and MMC-5 specs. No code but only
the pure SCSI knowledge has been taken from dvd+rw-tools, though.
