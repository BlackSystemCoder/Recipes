[Summary] Sound toolkit for scripting languages.
[Description] The Snack Sound Toolkit is designed to be used with a
scripting language such as Tcl/Tk or Python. Using Snack you can create
powerful multi-platform audio applications with just a few lines of
code. Snack has commands for basic sound handling, such as playback,
recording, file and socket I/O. Snack also provides primitives for sound
visualization, e.g. waveforms and spectrograms. It was developed mainly
to handle digital recordings of speech, but is just as useful for
general audio. Snack has also successfully been applied to other
one-dimensional signals.
The combination of Snack and a scripting language makes it possible to
create sound tools and applications with a minimum of effort. This is
due to the rapid development nature of scripting languages. As a bonus
you get an application that is cross-platform from start. It is also
easy to integrate Snack based applications with existing sound analysis
software.
