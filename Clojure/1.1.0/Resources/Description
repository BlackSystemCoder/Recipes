[Name] Clojure
[Summary] Dialect of Lisp that targets the Java Virtual Machine
[Description] Clojure is a dialect of Lisp that targets the Java Virtual 
Machine (and the CLR ). It is designed to be a general-purpose language, 
combining the approachability and interactive development of a scripting 
language with an efficient and robust infrastructure for multithreaded 
programming. Clojure is a compiled language - it compiles directly to JVM 
bytecode, yet remains completely dynamic. Every feature supported by Clojure 
is supported at runtime. Clojure provides easy access to the Java frameworks, 
with optional type hints and type inference, to ensure that calls to Java 
can avoid reflection.
