[Name] FakeChroot
[Summary] Gives a fake chroot environment
[Description] fakechroot runs a command in an environment were is additional possibility to use chroot(8) command without root privileges. This is useful for allowing users to create own chrooted environment with possibility to install another packages without need for root privileges. fakechroot replaces more library functions (chroot(2), open(2), etc.) by ones that simulate the effect the real library functions would have had, had the user really been in chroot. These wrapper functions are in a shared library /usr/lib/fakechroot/libfakechroot.so which is loaded through the LD_PRELOAD mechanism of the dynamic loader. (See ld.so(8))
