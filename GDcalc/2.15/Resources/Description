[Name] GDcalc
[Summary] A financial, statistics, scientific and programmers calculator.
[Description] Gdcalc is a financial, statistics, scientific and
programmers calculator for Unix and Linux. The GUI was written with
glade(1) and uses the Gnome/Gtk-2 toolkit - so it may well be compatible
with themes and other whiz-bang features of those systems.
Gdcalc has both Algebraic notation (ie. conventional, TI or Casio style)
and Reverse Polish Notation (RPN or Hewlett-Packard style). If you've
not heard of RPN before, you are probably familiar with algebraic
calculators. Very briefly, while simpler and more natural to use, RPN
calculators need some study eg. they have an Enter key instead of the
equals key.
