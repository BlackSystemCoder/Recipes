[Summary] Library for creating CORBA Interface Definition Language (IDL) files
[Description] libIDL is a library for creating trees of CORBA \
Interface Definition Language (IDL) files, which is a \
specification for defining portable interfaces. libIDL \
was initially written for ORBit (the ORB from the \
GNOME project, and the primary means of libIDL \
distribution). However, the functionality was \
designed to be as reusable and portable as \
possible.
