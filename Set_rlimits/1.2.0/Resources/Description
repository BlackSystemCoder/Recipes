[Name] Set_rlimits
[Summary] set_rlimits allows non-root apps to use realtime extensions
[Description] set_rlimits is a small wrapper program to allow people to take advantage of
the realtime resource limit extensions available in Linux kernels 2.6.12 and
later without having to resort to using a PAM module.  This is of particular
interest for Slackware users since Slackware doesn't use PAM, but other
users may find this program helpful as well.  In addition, several other
resource limits can be manipulated by the program.
