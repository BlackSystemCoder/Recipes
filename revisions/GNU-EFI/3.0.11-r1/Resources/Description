[Name] GNU-EFI
[Summary] Environment for compiling programs for EFI
[License] BSD License (revised) (2-clause)
[Description] The necessary environment for compiling some programs that run in the Extensible Firmware Interface, such as ELILO.  Confusingly, despite the name, it is not a GNU package, is unrelated to the GNU package GnuFI, and does not appear to have a homepage of its own.
