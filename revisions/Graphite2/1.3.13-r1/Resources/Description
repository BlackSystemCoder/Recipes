[Name] Graphite2
[Summary] Rendering engine for graphite fonts
[Description] Graphite2 is a rendering engine for graphite fonts. These are TrueType fonts with additional tables containing smart rendering information and were originally developed to support complex non-Roman writing systems. They may contain rules for e.g. ligatures, glyph substitution, kerning, justification - this can make them useful even on text written in Roman writing systems such as English.
