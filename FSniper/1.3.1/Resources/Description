[Name] FSniper
[Summary] Scriptable directory monitoring tool.
[Description] Fsniper is a tool that monitors a given set of directories
for new files. Then, based on the new file's type or name, it invokes a
script to be run (any executable via the shell) on that file. Common
uses include making a single drop directory for all things from a
webbrowser etc, and having semi-intelligent scripts figure out what to
do with those files. You write the scripts yourself.
