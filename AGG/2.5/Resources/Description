[Summary] Anti-Grain Geometry - A high quality rendering engine for C++
[Description] Anti-Grain Geometry (AGG) is a general purpose graphical toolkit written completely in standard and platform independent C++. It can be used in many areas of computer programming where high quality 2D graphics is an essential part of the project. For example, if you render 2D geographic maps AGG is a must. AGG uses only C++ and standard C runtime functions, such as memcpy, sin, cos, sqrt, etc. The basic algorithms don't even use C++ Standard Template Library. Thus, AGG can be used in a very large number of applications, including embedded systems.
