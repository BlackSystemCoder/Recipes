[Summary] Analysis of Compiler Options via Evolutionary Algorithm
[Description] ACOVEA (Analysis of Compiler Options via Evolutionary Algorithm) implements a genetic algorithm to find the "best" options for compiling programs with the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) C and C++ compilers. "Best", in this context, is defined as those options that produce the fastest executable program from a given source code. Acovea is a C++ framework that can be extended to test other programming languages and non-GCC compilers.
