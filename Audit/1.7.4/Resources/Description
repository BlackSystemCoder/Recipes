[Name] Audit
[Summary] The Linux Auditing Framework
[Description] The main LAF goals are to provide system call auditing with 
1) as low overhead as possible, and 2) without duplicating functionality 
that is already provided by SELinux (and/or other security infrastructures).

This framework will work "stand-alone", but is not designed to provide,
e.g., CAPP functionality without another security component in place.
