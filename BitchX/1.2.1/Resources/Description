[Name] BitchX
[Summary] BitchX is the most popular IRC client among Unix systems. You can also use it on Windows, but if you had a Picasso painting, would you put it in the bathroom?
[Description] Written by "Trench" and "HappyCrappy", was a script for the IrcII client. It was converted to a program on its own right by panasync in 1996.
A debt of gratitude is owed to panasync for his many hours of messing with code to make BitchX the great client that it is. Thanks man, and keep up the good work...
It is written in C and is a console application.
Even if Xchat or others have a friendly GUI, BitchX inludes features which make it an eggdrop, a bouncer and a friendly IRC client in the same time.
BitchX is the most popular IRC client among Unix systems. You can also use it on Windows, but if you had a Picasso painting, would you put it in the bathroom?
It is highly customizable and capable of running scripts, so it can be used as an irc bot too.
