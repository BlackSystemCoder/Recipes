#     - hack to gcc found the standard  headers
#
# From gcc man page:
#
#  GCC_EXEC_PREFIX
#           If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the 
#           names of the subprograms executed by the compiler. No slash is
#           added when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram,
#           but you can specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
#
#           If GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is not set, GCC will attempt to figure out an
#           appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it was invoked with.
#
#           If GCC cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it 
#           tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
#
#           The default value of GCC_EXEC_PREFIX is prefix/lib/gcc-lib/ where 
#           prefix is the value of "prefix" when you ran the configure script.
#
#           Other prefixes specified with -B take precedence over this prefix.
#
#           This prefix is also used for finding files such as crt0.o that are
#           used for linking.
#
#           In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
#           directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
#           directories whose name normally begins with /usr/local/lib/gcc-lib
#           (more precisely, with the value of GCC_INCLUDE_DIR), GCC tries 
#           replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an 
#           alternate directory name. Thus, with -Bfoo/, GCC will search foo/bar
#           where it would normally search /usr/local/lib/bar.  These alternate
#           directories are searched first; the standard directories come next.
#
