[Description] Resinstaller - installs graphics and sounds from Interplay's M.A.X. to M.A.X.R. for original game look and feel. For this you need an existing M.A.X. installation or an original M.A.X. CD avaible. If you don't own an original maxcd you've another chance in downloading Mechanized Assault and Exploration from cdosabandonware.com since you won't find any gamecds from this any more on stores - too old. http://www.cdosabandonware.com/std_games_details.php?gameid=1979
