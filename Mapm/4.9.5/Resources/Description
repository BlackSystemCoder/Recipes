[Description] My Arbitrary Precision Math library is a set of functions that allow the user to perform math to any level of accuracy that is desired. The precision of a number is only limited by 'INT_MAX' and available memory. For a 16 bit compiler, a number may have 2^15 digits (or ~32,000). For a 32 bit compiler, a number may have 2^31 digits (or ~2.14E+9). See the README file (in the distribution as well as a link below) for a more complete discussion of the actual numerical limitations.
