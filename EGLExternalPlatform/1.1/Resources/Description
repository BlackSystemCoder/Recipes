[Summary] EGL External Platform interface
[Description]
This is a work-in-progress specification of the EGL External Platform interface
for writing EGL platforms and their interactions with modern window systems on
top of existing low-level EGL platform implementations. This keeps window system
implementation specifics out of EGL drivers by using application-facing EGL functions.
