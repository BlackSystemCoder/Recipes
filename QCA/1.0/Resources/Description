[Name] QCA
[Summary] Qt Cryptographic Architecture
[Description] QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform
crypto API, using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API
from the implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The
advantage of this model is to allow applications to avoid linking to
or explicitly depending on any particular cryptographic library.
