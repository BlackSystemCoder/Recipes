[Summary] The Qt Cryptographic Architecture
[Description] Taking a hint from the similarly-named Java Cryptography 	
Architecture, QCA aims to provide a straightforward and cross-platform 	
crypto API, using Qt datatypes and conventions. QCA separates the API from 	
the implementation, using plugins known as Providers. The advantage of this 	
model is to allow applications to avoid linking to or explicitly depending 	
on any particular cryptographic library. This allows one to easily change or 	
upgrade crypto implementations without even needing to recompile the 	
application!
