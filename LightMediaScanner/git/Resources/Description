[Name] LightMediaScanner
[Summary] Lightweight media scanner
[Description] Lightweight media scanner meant to be used in not-so-powerful devices,
like embedded systems or old machines.

Provides an optimized way to recursively scan directories, handling
the parser in a child process, avoiding breaks of the main process
when parsers break (quite common with such bad libs and tags). One can
opt to use the single process version, but be aware that if something
bad happens during parsing, your application will suffer.

Parsers are plugins in the form of shared objects, so it's easy to add
new without having to recompile the scanner.
