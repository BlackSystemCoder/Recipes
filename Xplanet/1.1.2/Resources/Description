Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into the X root window. All of the major 
planets and most satellites can be drawn, similar to JPL's Solar System Simulator. A number of different map 
projections are also supported, including azimuthal, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, and rectangular.
