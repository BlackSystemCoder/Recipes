[Summary] Rendering engine for MathML documents
[Description] GtkMathView is a C++ rendering engine for MathML
documents. It provides an interactive view that can be used for
browsing and editing MathML markup. 

GtkMathView reads MathML documents by means of a frontend whose
purpose is to traverse the MathML document (or part of it) and to
appropriately instantiate GtkMathView's internal data structures that
are suitable for rendering it. Currently the following frontends are
supported: libxml2, libxml2 reader, GMetaDOM, custom. 

GtkMathView renders MathML documents through a backend whose purpose
is to provide an interface between the portable rendering engine and
the platform-specific capabilities (like retrieving fonts, drawing on
the screen, and so on). Currently the following backends are provided:
GTK+, GTK+ widget, SVG, AbiWord.
