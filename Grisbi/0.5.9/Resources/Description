[Summary] Grisbi is a personnal accounting application
[Description] Grisbi is a personnal accounting application running under GNU/Linux and Windows, released under the GPL licence. Our aim is to provide you with the most simple and intuitive software for basic use, and still very 
powerful if you spend a little time on the setup. Grisbi can manage multiple accounts, currencies and users. It manages third party, expenditure and receipt categories, as well as budgetary lines, financial years, and other informations that makes it quite adapted for 
associations (except those that require double entry accounting). The exhaustive list of Grisbi's functionalities can be found in the User's guide, paragraph 1.2.
