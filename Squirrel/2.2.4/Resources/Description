[Summary] A lightweight OO scripting language with C/C++-like syntax.
[Description] Squirrel is a high level imperative/OO programming

* Open Source zlib/libpng license
* dynamic typing
* delegation
* classes & inheritance
* higher order functions
* generators
* cooperative threads(coroutines) 
* tail recursion
* exception handling
* automatic memory management (CPU bursts free; mixed approach ref counting/GC)
* weak references
* both compiler and virtual machine fit together in about 6k lines of C++ code.
* optional 16bits characters strings
* compiles on both 32 and 64 bits architectures 
Squirrel is inspired by languages like Python,Javascript and especially
Lua(The API is very similar and the table code is based on the Lua one)
