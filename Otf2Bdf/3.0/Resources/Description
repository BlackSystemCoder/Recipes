[Name] Otf2Bdf
[Summary] Otf2bdf is a CLI utility to generate BDF fonts from OpenType/TrueType fonts
[Description] otf2bdf is a command line utility that uses the FreeType 2 font rendering library to generate BDF bitmap fonts from OpenType outline fonts at different sizes and resolutions. This program is essentially the same as the ttf2bdf program except that it uses FreeType 2.*, not FreeType 1.*, has some bug fixes, and includes a new command line parameter to print out the available encoding tables in the font.
