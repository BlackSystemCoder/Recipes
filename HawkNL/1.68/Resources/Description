[Summary] A portable networking library.
[Description] HawkNL is a free, open source, game oriented network API. It is a fairly low level API, a wrapper over Berkeley/Unix Sockets and Winsock. But it also provides other features including support for many OSs, groups of sockets, socket statistics, high accuracy timer, CRC functions, macros to read and write data to packets with endian conversion, and support for multiple network transports.
