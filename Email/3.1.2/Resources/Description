[Name] Email
[Summary] A command line email sending program
[Description] Email sends email to remote SMTP servers via the command line, 
which makes it useful in cron jobs. It will send to any RFC standard remote 
ESMTP server, and will allow you to encrypt, sign, and design your message 
on the fly. It has the capability to use signature files with dynamic options, 
address book functionality, and users can also attach pictures, binary files, 
documents, or whatever they want. It is completely compatible with GNUPG for 
encryption and signing, and is easy to configure and use.
