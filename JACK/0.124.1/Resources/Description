[Description]
JACK is a low-latency audio server, written for POSIX conformant operating systems such as 
GNU/Linux and Apple's OS X. It can connect a number of different applications to an audio 
device, as well as allowing them to share audio between themselves.
JACK was designed from the ground up for professional audio work, and its design focuses on
two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and low latency operation.
