[Description] A Linux kernel device driver for Atheros-based Wireless \
LAN devices. The driver works such that your WLAN card will appear as \
a normal network interface in the system. Additionally there is \
support for the Wireless Extensions API. This allows you to configure \
the device using common wireless tools (ifconfig, iwconfig and friends).
