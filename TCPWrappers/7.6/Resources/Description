[Name] TCPWrappers
[Summary] TCP Wrappers Toolkit
[Description] The TCP Wrappers package allows you to monitor and filter incoming \
requests for various network services. It provides tiny daemon wrapper programs \
that can be installed without any changes to existing software or to existing \
configuration files. The wrappers report the name of the client host and of the \
requested service. The wrappers do not exchange information with the client or \
server applications, and impose no overhead on the actual conversation between \
the client and server applications. Additionally, the wrapper functionality is \
available as a C API for use in other networking applications, too.
