[Description] an HTTP server written in PHP, designed to be small,
secure, and extensible.


GOBO SPECIFIC NOTE: This recipe will install Nanoweb.  The Nanoweb
installer does a pretty good job of setting up pathes correctly.
However, there are a couple paths that you will need to fix manually.
When you run nanoctl, the error messages will make it obvious which
paths need to be fixed.

I would have added patches to the Recipe to fix these issues, but my
document root had many symlinks inside it, which Nanoweb seemed to
consider to be a security violation.  When I disabled symlink
checking, Nanoweb/PHP started core dumping on me, perhaps due to a
FastCGI issue.  At this point I decided Nanoweb was too much work,
switched back to using Lighttpd, which works fine with the same PHP
executable.

If anyone wants to use Nanoweb with Gobo in the future, starting with
this recipe may save them some time.  I was able to successfully serve
static HTML pages and PHP pages with Nanoweb prior to giving up due to
the coredumps.
