Mrxvt (previously known as materm) is a multi-tab X terminal emulator based on rxvt/aterm. It supports 
multiple tabs, runtime dynamic tab title, pseudo-transparent backgrounds, user-supplied background images 
(JPEG, PNG, or XPM), background color tinting, text shadows, NeXT/rxvt/xterm/SGI style scrollbars, XIM, 
multiple languages (Chinese, Korean, and Japanese) and logging. It is lightweight and fast, and only depends 
on Xlib.
