[Name] GoFonts
[Summary] The Go font family. 
[Description] The Go font family. The font family provides a 
 proportional and a fixed-width font face in normal, bold, and italic 
 versions for technical uses, particularly programming. As hinted by the
 name, Go source code looks particularly good when displayed in Go fonts
 as punctuation characters are easily distinguishable and operators are
 lined up and placed consistently.
