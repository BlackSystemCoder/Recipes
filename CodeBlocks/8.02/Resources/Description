[Name] Code::Blocks
[Summary] A cross-platform C++ IDE
[Description] Codeblocks is a cross-platform C++ IDE built around
wxWidgets, designed to be extensible and configurable. Most of its
functionality is already provided by plugins. Plugins included in the
base package are:

   * Compiler frontend to many free compilers
   * Debugger frontend for GDB (and CDB for windows platforms)
   * Source formatter (based on AStyle)
   * Wizard to create new C++ classes
   * Code-completion / symbols-browser (work in progress)
   * Default MIME handler
   * Wizard to create new Code::Blocks plugins
   * To-do list
   * Extensible wizard based on scripts (for creating new
     projects/targets/etc) 
   * Autosave (saves your work in the unfortunate case of a crash)
