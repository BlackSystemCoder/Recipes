[Name] LibCoyotl
[Summary] A collection of portable C++ classes by Scott Robert Ladd
[Description] The libcoyotl class collection defies clear categorization; in essence,
these are tool that I've found useful in a variety of applications.
Rather than have several "little" libraries lying about, I decided to
create a single "catch all" library.
