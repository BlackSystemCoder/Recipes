[Name] Atomic_ops
[Summary] Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a number of architectures.
[Description] Provides implementations for atomic memory update operations on a number of 
architectures. This allows direct use of these in reasonably portable code. Unlike earlier 
similar packages, this one explicitly considers memory barrier semantics, and allows the 
construction of code that involves minimum overhead across a variety of architectures.
