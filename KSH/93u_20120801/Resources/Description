[Name] KSH
[Summary] Real, AT&T version of the Korn shell
[Description] Ksh is a UNIX command interpreter (shell) that is intended for
both interactive and shell script use. Its command language is a superset of
the sh(1) shell language. 
The 1993 version adds a number of new, mostly scripting related, features over
the 1988 version that is typically distributed with commercial UNIX variants.
For example, it has lexical scoping, compound variables, associative arrays,
named references and floating point math.
