[Name] LTFS-SDE
[Summary] The Linear Tape File System - Single Drive Edition
[Description] LTFS is an open standard, interchangeable with other
LTO-5 and LTO-6 brands, and is also cross-platform, so you can use
the tape as you would a USB flash drive. Simply load an LTFS-formatted
tape into your LTO-5 or LTO-6 drive, mount it into the file system,
and it becomes visible as if it were a disk.
