[Name] Notification-Daemon
[Summary] Desktop Notification Framework notification daemon.
[Description] Notification-Daemon is a daemon which manages drawing \
notifications using theme engines on the desktop. These notifications \
are designed to notify the user of something without interrupting \
their work with a dialog box that they must close. Passive popups can \
automatically disappear after a short period of time. \
Notification-Daemon is spawned through a DBUS API and can use DBus to \
create notifications.
