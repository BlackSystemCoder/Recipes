[Name] FunionFS
[Summary] An UnionFS implementation in userspace on FUSE
[Description] FunionFS is the aggregation of two filesystems: a read-only 
and a read-write one. The read-only filesystem could be a CDROM or a flash 
disk for an embedded system. The read-write filesystem could be a Ramdisk 
or a partition on an USB key... All data is read from the read-only 
filesystem if it's not present on the read write one. Data is written 
to the read-write filesystem.
