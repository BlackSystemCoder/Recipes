Java-DNSJava

[Summary]
An implementation of DNS in the Java programming language.

[Description]
dnsjava is an implementation of DNS in Java. It supports all defined 
record types (including the DNSSEC types), and unknown types. It can 
be used for queries, zone transfers, and dynamic updates. It includes 
a cache which can be used by clients, and a minimal implementation of 
a server. It supports TSIG authenticated messages, partial DNSSEC 
verification, and EDNS0.

dnsjava provides functionality above and beyond that of the InetAddress 
class. Since it is written in pure Java, dnsjava is fully threadable, 
and in many cases is faster than using InetAddress.

dnsjava provides both high and low level access to DNS. The high level 
functions perform queries for records of a given name, type, and class, 
and return the answer or reason for failure. There are also functions 
similar to those in the InetAddress class. A cache is used to reduce 
the number of DNS queries sent. The low level functions allow direct 
manipulation of DNS messages and records, as well as allowing additional 
resolver properties to be set.

A simple tool for doing DNS lookups, a 'dig' clone and a dynamic update 
client are included, as well as a simple authoritative-only server.
