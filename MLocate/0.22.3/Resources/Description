[Name] MLocate
[Summary] Find files in the system using a generated database
[Description] MLocate is a new locate implementation a tool to find
files anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed
pattern or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1),
locate uses a previously created database to perform the search,
allowing queries to execute much faster. This database is updated
periodically from cron.

The locate(1) utility is intended to be completely compatible to
slocate. It also attempts to be compatible to GNU locate, when it does
not conflict with slocate compatibility.
