[Name] LibLZF
[Summary] A small data compression library
[License] BSD-like
[Description] LibLZF is a very small data compression library. It is \
very easy to incorporate into your own programs. The compression \
algorithm is very fast, rivaling a straight copy loop, especially for \
decompression which is basically at (unoptimized) memcpy-speed.
