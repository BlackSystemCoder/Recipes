[Name] Guimup
[Summary] client for the music player daemon (MPD) written in C++ and GTKmm.
[Description] GUIMUP is a client for the music player daemon (MPD)
written in C++ and GTKmm. The program can be used with most Linux
desktops but, as a GTK program, is best suited for GNOME and XFCE.
The focus of the program is on mouse handling: playlist management is
done entirely by drag-&-drop; playback functions are directly accessible
from the system tray. Guimup turns MPD into a perfect desktop music
player.
