[Name] NTFS-3G-Advanced
[Summary] A read/write NTFS driver with advanced features
[Description] While the NTFS-3G project gobally aims at providing a stable NTFS driver for several operating systems such as Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, Solaris etc., the advanced branch specifically aims at developing, maturing, and releasing features to get user feedback before they are integrated in the main branch. The advanced releases are designed as add-ons to the latest stable release, so they benefit from all the improvements and fixes integrated in the main branch. This facilitates the subsequent integration of the newer features both for the developer and the user. The current advanced features are as follows: file ownership and permissions (the ownership and permissions of files, implemented according to POSIX rules, are interoperable with Windows), POSIX ACLs, full UTF-8 file naming (any Unicode character is allowed in file names, if a UTF-8 encoding is selected), optimizations (frequently used data are cached to improve speed), and junction points (the junction points created by Windows are seen as symlinks).
