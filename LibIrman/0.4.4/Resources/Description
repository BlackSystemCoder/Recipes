[Name] LibIrman
[Summary] Library for accessing the Irman infrared hardware
[Description] libirman is a library that allows access to Irman Infra
Red hardware from Linux and other Unix systems. 

For general application programming, the preferred interface for
infra-red control is lirc', as lirc supports multiple programs sharing
the same infra-red receiver. It does this by providing a socket based
interface to which several programs can connect. 

lirc uses libirman to interface with the Irman Infra Red hardware, so
in single use applications directly using libirman is simpler and uses
less system resources. Currently, lirc only works on Linux systems, so
programs written using libirman directly are more portable.
