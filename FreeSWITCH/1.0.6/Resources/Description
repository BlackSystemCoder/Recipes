[Description] FreeSWITCH is an open source telephony platform designed to facilitate the
creation of voice and chat driven products scaling from a soft-phone up to
a soft-switch.  It can be used as a simple switching engine, a PBX, a media
gateway or a media server to host IVR applications using simple scripts or
XML to control the callflow.

We support various communication technologies such as SIP, H.323, IAX2 and
GoogleTalk making it easy to interface with other open source PBX systems
such as sipX, OpenPBX, Bayonne, YATE or Asterisk.
