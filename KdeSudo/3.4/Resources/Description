[Name] KdeSudo
[Summary] A graphical sudo frontend for KDE.
[Description] KdeSudo is a sudo frontend for KDE originaly developed by Robert Gruber, and now maintained by Kubuntu developers.
KDE's normal KdeSu doesn't deal correctly with sudo, and is only capable of authentication.
It doesn't deal with sudo specific features like NOPASSWD and so on.
KdeSudo acts like a wrapper for sudo commands, and therefore, supports all "sudoers" file options.
It is command line compatible with KdeSu, and can replace it simply with linking /usr/bin/kdesu to /usr/bin/kdesudo (KDE3 version) or ${kde4_path}/lib/kde4/libexec/kdesu to ${kde4_path}/bin/kdesudo
