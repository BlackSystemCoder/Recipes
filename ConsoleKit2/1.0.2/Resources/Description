[Name] ConsoleKit2
[Summary] Fork of Consolekit
[Description] ConsoleKit2 is a framework for defining and tracking users, login
sessions, and seats. It allows multiple users to be logged in at the
same time and share hardware for their graphical session. ConsoleKit2
will keep track of those resources and whichever session is active
will have use of the hardware at that time.
