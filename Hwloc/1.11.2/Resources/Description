[Name] Hwloc
[Summary] Portable Hardware Locality
[Description]  The Portable Hardware Locality (hwloc) software package
provides a portable abstraction (across OS, versions, architectures, ...) of
the hierarchical topology of modern architectures, including NUMA memory
nodes, sockets, shared caches, cores and simultaneous multithreading. It also
gathers various system attributes such as cache and memory information as well
as the locality of I/O devices such as network interfaces, InfiniBand HCAs or
GPUs.
