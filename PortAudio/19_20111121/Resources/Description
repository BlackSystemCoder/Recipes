[Summary] PortAudio is a free, cross platform, open-source, audio I/O library. 
[Description] It lets you write simple audio programs in 'C' that will compile and run on many platforms including Windows, Macintosh (8,9,X), Unix (OSS), SGI, and BeOS. PortAudio is intended to promote the exchange of audio synthesis software between developers on different platforms.
