[Name] Printer-Applet
[Summary] A KDE system tray utility that shows current print jobs and printer status.
[Description] Printer Applet is a system tray utility that shows current print jobs, shows printer warnings and errors and shows when printers that have been plugged in for the first time are being auto-configured by hal-cups-utils. It is a port of the applet from Red Hat's system-config-printer to KDE. Printer Applet is the first application in the mainline KDE modules to be written with PyKDE.
