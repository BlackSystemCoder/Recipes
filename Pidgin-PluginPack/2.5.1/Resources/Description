[Summary] pidgin plugin pack
[Description] many plugins for pidign 
The Purple Plugin Pack was originally created by Gary Kramlich and Stu Tomlinson as a way to distribute their ever growing lists of simple Pidgin plugins. It has since grown from its origins of about 6 plugins to nearly 50. Also, many more developers have continued to add to it, including John Bailey, Peter Lawler, Sadrul Habib Chowdhury, and most recently Richard Laager.
