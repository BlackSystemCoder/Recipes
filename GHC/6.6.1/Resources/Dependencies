#GHC >= 6.0
#technically ghc 6.6 only depends on >= 5.04, but 6.8 will depend on >= 6.0,
#and 5.04 is older than any Gobo recipe/package I found anyway.
#Unfortunately cyclic dependencies (on binaries - not really cyclic :)
#are likely to badly confuse tools like Freshen at least.  So until (unless)
#we work out a good solution here, this dependency will just have to
#remain "disabled".
