Xerces-C++

[Summary] 
Xerces-C++ is a validating XML parser written in a portable subset of C++.

[Description] 
Xerces-C++ makes it easy to give your application the ability to read
and write XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating,
and validating XML documents using the DOM, SAX, and SAX2 APIs.

The parser provides high performance, modularity, and scalability. Source code, samples
and API documentation are provided with the parser. For portability, care has been taken
to make minimal use of templates, no RTTI, and minimal use of #ifdefs.)
