[Description] getmail is a mail retriever designed to allow you to get your mail from one or more mail accounts on various mail servers to your local machine for reading with a minimum of fuss. getmail is designed to be secure, flexible, reliable, and easy-to-use. getmail is designed to replace other mail retrievers such as fetchmail.   Fetchmail can transfer mail from practically every kind of remote mail store, however buggy that remote server may be. Fetchmail's size and method of taking mail that has already been delivered and re-rerouting it via smtp, is the reason many people use the alternative getmail program.
