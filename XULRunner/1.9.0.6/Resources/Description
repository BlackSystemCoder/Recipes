[Name] XULRunner
[Summary] A runtime environment for XUL applications
[Description] XULRunner is a single "gecko runtime" that can be used
to bootstrap multiple XUL + XPCOM applications that are as rich as
Firefox and Thunderbird. 
XUL is Mozilla's XML based User Interface language that lets you build
feature-rich cross platform applications. These applications are
easily customized with alternative text, graphics and layout so that
they can be readily branded or localized for various markets. Web
developers already familiar with Dynamic HTML (DHTML) will learn XUL
quickly and can start building applications right away.
