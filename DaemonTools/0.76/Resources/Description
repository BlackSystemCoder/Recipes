[Description] daemontools is a collection of tools for managing
(i.e. starting, stopping and restarting) UNIX services.  DaemonTools
is used by djbdns and tinydns, among others.

This recipe only installs the daemontools programs.

This recipe DOES NOT:
  * create the /service directory
  * run svscan
  * cause svscan to run at boot-time

Perhaps someday automatic configuration will be implemented in a
Gobo-appropriate way, but at present auto-configuration is not
implemented.  Please see the website for instructions on manually
configuring svscan and the other daemontools.
