[Name] LibISOBurn
[Summary] Tool to create and expand ISO-9660 filesystems
[Description] Libisoburn is a frontend for libraries libburn and
libisofs which enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems
on all CD/DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like
DVD+RW, which do not support multi-session management on media level
and even plain disk files or block devices. 
The price for that is thorough specialization on data files in
ISO-9660 filesystem images. So libisoburn is not suitable for audio
(CD-DA) or any other CD layout which does not entirely consist of
ISO-9660 sessions.
