[Description]
The G System, often simply called "G", is an effort to create exactly this: simulation of evolution. 
This is both, a scientific exercise and a virtual reality where many "users" can participate in an ever changing, realistic and ... evolving universe.
G is basically a framework for virtual world simulations. And not only a framework (the "G System") but a virtual reality itself, which will become the application created with the G System.
