[Name] Unsermake
[Summary] A replacement tool for Automake from the KDE project
[Description] Unsermake replaces 'automake' and 'make' but keeps everything \
else, including the same Makefile.am syntax. Unsermake creates one large Makefile \
rather than one per directory, making compilations faster, especially on SMP or \
distributed compiling machines.
