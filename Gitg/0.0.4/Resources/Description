[Name] Gitg
[Summary] Gitg is a git repository viewer targeting gtk+/GNOME.
[Description] gitg targets cases where it is useful to provide a graphical representation of git data or actions. The history view is a good example where graphical representation helps to get an overview of the repository. gitg does not aim to be an advanced tool which allows access to every feature of git through a graphical interface, it will however try to incorporate common actions which might require multiple actions on the command line (like staging, unstaging, reverting and committing).
