[Description] Security, speed, compliance, and flexibility--all of
these describe LightTPD which is rapidly redefining efficiency of a
webserver; as it is designed and optimized for high performance
environments. With a small memory footprint compared to other
web-servers, effective management of the cpu-load, and advanced
feature set (FastCGI, CGI, Auth, Output-Compression, URL-Rewriting and
many more) LightTPD is the perfect solution for every server that is
suffering load problems. And best of all it's Open Source licensed
under the revised BSD license.
