[Name] Kommander
[Summary] Kommander is a small to medium application builder
[Description] Kommander is a two part application. The first part is the editor where you visually build dialogs and applications and edit the scripting elements. The second part is the executor which processes the generated XML file. Kommander is a non traditional "disruptive" technology. It does not compile applications but it does not do build it's interface through interpreted scripting and it's DCOP calls are compiled functions. So it produces dialogs and applications that are very small for internet transmission, run very fast and do not have binary issues.
