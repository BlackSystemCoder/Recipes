[Name] ST
[Summary] st is a simple terminal implementation for X.
[Description] xterm is bloated and unmaintainable. The popular alternative,
rxvt has only 32K lines of code. This is just too much for something as simple
as a terminal emulator; it’s yet another example of code complexity. Terminal
emulation doesn’t need to be so complex.
