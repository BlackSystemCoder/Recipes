[Name] Splint
[Summary] Annotation-Assisted Lightweight Static Checking
[Description] Splint is a tool for statically checking C programs for security
vulnerabilities and coding mistakes. With minimal effort, Splint can be used
as a better lint. If additional effort is invested adding annotations to
programs, Splint can perform stronger checking than can be done by any
standard lint.
