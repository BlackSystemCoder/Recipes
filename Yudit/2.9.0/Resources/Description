[Name] Yudit
[Summary] Yudit is a free Unicode plain-text editor for Unix-like systems.
[Description] This editor does not use external libraries, except for the C library and a minimal set of windowing functions. This has helped to make a quick port to platforms where there was no multilingual support. This is also the reason why Yudit looks so ... unique :).
