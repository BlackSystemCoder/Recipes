[Name] Twisted
[Summary] Twisted is an event-driven networking engine written in Python.
[Description] Like any engine, Twisted has many "moving parts."
Twisted Projects is our name for these components of Twisted. 
Taken together, they form the whole of Twisted. 
Twisted projects variously support TCP, UDP, SSL/TLS, multicast, 
Unix sockets, a large number of protocols (including HTTP, NNTP,
IMAP, SSH, IRC, FTP, and others), and much more.
