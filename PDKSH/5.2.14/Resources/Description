[Description] PD-ksh is a clone of the AT&T Korn shell. At the moment, it has most of the ksh88 features, not much of the ksh93 features, and a number of its own features.
pdksh's strong points are:
- its free and quite portable - you should be able to compile it easily on pretty much any unix box.
- the vi editing mode is better (IMHO) than that of ksh88 or ksh93 (command/file completion using tab (optional), less buggy).
