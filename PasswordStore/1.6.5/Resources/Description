[Name] PassStore
[Summary] The standard unix password manager
[Description] Password management should be simple and follow Unix philosophy.
With pass, each password lives inside of a gpg encrypted file whose filename is
the title of the website or resource that requires the password. These
encrypted files may be organized into meaningful folder hierarchies, copied
from computer to computer, and, in general, manipulated using standard command
line file management utilities.  [License] GNU General Public License version 2
