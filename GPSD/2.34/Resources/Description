[Summary] GPSD is a service daemon that monitors one or more GPSes
[Description] GPSD is a daemon that listens to a GPS or Loran receiver and translates the positional data into a simplified format that can be more easily used by other programs, like chart plotters. The package comes with a sample client that plots the location of the currently visible GPS satellites (if available) and a speedometer. It can also use DGPS/ip.
