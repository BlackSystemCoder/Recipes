[Description] lzop is a file compressor which is very similar to gzip. lzop uses the LZO data compression library (the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhumer algorithm) for compression services, and its main advantages over gzip are much higher compression and decompression speed (at the cost of some compression ratio).
