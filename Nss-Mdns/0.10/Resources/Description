[Description]

nss-mdns is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing host name
resolution via Multicast DNS (aka Zeroconf, aka Apple Rendezvous, aka
Apple Bonjour), effectively allowing name resolution by common
Unix/Linux programs in the ad-hoc mDNS domain .local.


GOBO SPECIFIC NOTE: If you Compile wget in Rootless on Ubuntu, wget
may fail to run if Nss-Mdns is not also installed.


nss-mdns provides client functionality only, which means that you have
to run a mDNS responder daemon seperately from nss-mdns if you want to
register the local host name via mDNS. I recommend Avahi.

nss-mdns is very lightweight (9 KByte stripped binary .so compiled
with -DNDEBUG=1 -Os on i386, gcc 4.0), has no dependencies besides the
glibc and requires only minimal configuration.

By default nss-mdns tries to contact a running avahi-daemon for
resolving host names and addresses and making use of its superior
record cacheing. Optionally nss-mdns can be compiled with a mini mDNS
stack that can be used to resolve host names without a local Avahi
installation. Both Avahi support and this mini mDNS stack are
optional, however at least one of them needs to be enabled. If both
are enabled a connection to Avahi is tried first, and if that fails
the mini mDNS stack is used.
