Scrot

[Summary]
A commandline screen capture utility.

[Description]
Scrot is a commandline tool for capturing screenshots of an X 
desktop, like the ImageMagick tool import. Instead of using 
those libraries Scrot uses Imlib2.

Scrot has lots of options for autogenerating filenames and can 
do fun stuff like taking screenshots of multiple displays and 
gluing them together.
