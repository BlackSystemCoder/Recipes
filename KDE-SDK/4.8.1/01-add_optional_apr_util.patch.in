APR-Util is a Subversion dependency, which in turn is an optional
dependency to KDE-SDK. However, APR-Util headers are installed under
$prefix/Current/include/apr-1, which is not included in
the default search path. This patch adds a harmless $goboHeaders/apr-1
to the include search path so that the compilation finishes with no
errors. Well, at least without errors related to APR-Util :-)
