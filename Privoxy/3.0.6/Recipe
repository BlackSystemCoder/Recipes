#According to INSTALL,
#Then, to build from either unpacked tarball or CVS source:
#
# autoheader                                                                    
# autoconf                                                                      
# ./configure      # (--help to see options)                                    
# make             # (the make from GNU, sometimes called gmake)                
# su               # Possibly required                                          
# make -n install  # (to see where all the files will go)                       
# make -s install  # (to really install, -s to silence output)                  
#
#Using GNU make, you can have the first four steps automatically done for you by
#just typing:
#
#  make                                                                         

#We need to do the ./configure ourselves so we can set the
#gobo-specific prefixes, I think, so type "makefile" won't do:
recipe_type=configure
pre_build() {
  # configure complains about "not GNU Make" otherwise:
  unalias make

# This recipe should probably make a "privoxy" user and group,
# if there is a good way to specify that a program wants such
# things to be present...
#copied from HAL 0.5.9-r1 recipe, and user/group name changed:
   if ! grep -q "privoxy" $goboSettings/group
   then
      Log_Normal "Adding group privoxy"
      groupadd privoxy
   fi
   if ! grep -q "privoxy:x:" $goboSettings/passwd
   then
      Log_Normal "Adding user privoxy"
      useradd -g privoxy -c 'Added by Compile' -d $goboVariable/empty -s $goboExecutables/false privoxy
   fi

  autoheader && autoconf
