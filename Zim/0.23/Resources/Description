Zim

[Summary]
A desktop wiki and outliner.

[Description]
Zim is a WYSIWYG text editor written in Gtk2-Perl which aims to bring 
the concept of a wiki to your desktop. Every page is saved as a text 
file with wiki markup. Pages can contain links to other pages, and 
are saved automatically. Creating a new page is as easy as linking 
to a non-existing page. Pages are ordered in a hierarchical structure 
that gives it the look and feel of an outliner. This tool is 
intended to keep track of TODO lists or to serve as a personal 
scratch book.
