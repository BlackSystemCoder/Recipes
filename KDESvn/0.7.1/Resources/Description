[Name] KDESvn
[Summary] KDESvn is a frontend to the subversion vcs. In difference to most other tools it uses the subversion C-Api direct via a c++ wrapper made by Rapid SVN and doesn't parse the output of the subversion client. So it is a real client itself instead of a frontend to the command line tool.
