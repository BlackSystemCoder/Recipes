[Name] BZR-Upload
[Summary] Bazaar plugin that incrementally uploads changes to a dumb server.
[Description] Plugin for the Bazaar version control system (bazaar-vcs.org)

Incrementally uploads changes to a dumb server.

Web sites are often hosted on servers where bzr can't be installed. In other
cases, the web site must not give access to its corresponding branch (for
security reasons for example). Finally, web hosting providers often provides
only ftp access to upload sites.

This plugin uploads only the relevant changes since the last upload using ftp
or sftp protocols.
