[Name] CVS2SVN
[Summary] CVS2SVN is a tool for migrating a CVS repository to Subversion or GIT.
[Description] CVS2SVN infers what happened in the history of your CVS repository 
and replicates that history as accurately as possible in the target SCM. All 
revisions, branches, tags, log messages, author names, and commit dates are 
converted. CVS2SVN deduces what CVS modifications were made at the same time, 
and outputs these modifications grouped together as changesets in the target SCM.
CVS2SVN also deals with many CVS quirks and is highly configurable.
