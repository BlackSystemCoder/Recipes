Mp3blaster is an interactive text-based program that plays several audio file types (MP3, Ogg Vorbis, wav, and 
sid). It is one of the few audio players for the text console that allows full interactive control during 
playback. One of its key features is the ability to compose a very flexible playlist (while playing!). It 
plays most MP3 formats and has full mixer support built in.
