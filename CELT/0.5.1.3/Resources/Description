[Name] CELT
[Summary] High quality audio codec
[Description]  The CELT codec is a compression algorithm for audio. Like
MP3, Vorbis, and AAC it is suitable for transmitting music with high
quality. Unlike these formats CELT imposes very little delay on the
signal, even less than is typical for speech centric formats like Speex,
GSM, or G.729.
Using CELT application developers can build software that allows
musicians to perform together across the Internet, or simply build great
sounding telephony systems.
Like other open and unencumbered technology from the Xiph.Org Foundation
CELT requires no royalties and no complicated licensing.
