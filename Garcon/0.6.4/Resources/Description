[Name] Garcon
[Summary] Freedesktop.org compliant menu library for Xfce
[Description] Garcon is an implementation of the freedesktop.org compliant
menu specification replacing the former Xfce menu library libxfce4menu.

It is based on GLib/GIO and aims at covering the entire specification except
for legacy menus.

It was started as a complete rewrite of the former Xfce menu library called
libxfce4menu, which, in contrast to garcon, was lacking menu merging
features essential for loading menus modified with menu editors.
