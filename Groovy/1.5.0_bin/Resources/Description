Groovy

[Summary]
    Groovy is an agile langue which can leverage the JVM.

[Description]
    Groovy is an agile and dynamic language for the Java Virtual 
Machine that builds upon the strengths of Java but has additional 
power features inspired by languages like Python, Ruby and Smalltalk.
    Groovy attempts to makes modern programming features available 
to Java developers with almost-zero learning curve and supports 
Domain Specific Languages and other compact syntax so your code 
becomes easy to read and maintain. It makes writing shell and build 
scripts easy with its powerful processing primitives, OO abilities 
and an Ant DSL that increases developer productivity by reducing 
scaffolding code when developing web, GUI, database or console 
applications.
    Groovy tries to simplify testing by supporting unit testing and 
mocking out-of-the-box and seamlessly integrates with all existing 
Java objects and libraries. It compiles straight to Java bytecode so 
you can use it anywhere you can use Java.
