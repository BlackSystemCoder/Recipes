[Summary] A download accelerator for GNU/Linux
[Description]
ProZilla is a program that makes multiple connections and
downloads a file in multiple parts simultaneously thus
enhancing the download speed and downloading the file
faster than a download with a single connection.

possible sites that contain the same file, ping them for
connection speeds and automatically download from the
fastest site, or ask the user to choose one.
