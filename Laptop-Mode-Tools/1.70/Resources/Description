[Summary] Power Savings tool for Linux
[Description] Laptop Mode Tools is a laptop power saving package for Linux
systems. It is the primary way to enable the Laptop Mode feature of the Linux
kernel, which lets your hard drive spin down. In addition, it allows you to
tweak a number of other power-related settings using a simple configuration
file. Combined with acpid and CPU frequency scaling, LMT provides most users
with a complete notebook power management suite.
