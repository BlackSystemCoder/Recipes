[Description]

Copas is a dispatcher based on coroutines that can be used by TCP/IP
servers. It uses LuaSocket as the interface with the TCP/IP stack.

A server registered with Copas should provide a handler for requests
and use Copas socket functions to send the response. Copas loops
through requests and invokes the corresponding handlers. For a full
implementation of a Copas HTTP server you can refer to Xavante as an
example.
