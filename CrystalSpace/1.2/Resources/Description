[Name] CrystalSpace
[Summary] Crystal Space is a free and portable 3D engine written in C++. 
[Description] CrystalSpace is a portable modular 3D SDK, including many 
components for building various applications and games - these are still 
quite useful for projects that do not involve 3D. CS is still very much 
in development, so anyone who feels inclined to do so can contribute to 
the source.
