[Description] IEEE 802.1d ethernet bridging (plus Spanning Tree protocol) for
the linux kernel. Kernel code is in Linux 2.4 and 2.6 kernels. A Linux bridge
is more powerful than a pure hardware bridge because it can also filter and
shape traffic. The combination of bridging and firewalling is done with the
companion project ebtables.
