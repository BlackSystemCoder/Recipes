[Description] SimGear is a set of open-source libraries designed to be used as building blocks for quickly assembling 3d simulations, games, and visualization applications.
SimGear is a relatively new project, and while quite a bit of code has been written in conjunction with the FlightGear project, the final interface and arrangements are still evolving.
The term "Simulation Kernel" is a bit presumptuous for us at this point, but this is the direction we are heading with SimGear.
