[Name] Wine
[Summary] An Open Source implementation of the Windows API
[Description] Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation which
allows running Microsoft Windows programs (including DOS, Windows 3.x
and Win32 executables) on Unix.
Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free
alternative implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100%
non-Microsoft code, however Wine can optionally use native Windows
DLLs if they are available.
Wine provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source
code to Unix as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified
Windows programs to run on x86-based Unixes, including Linux, FreeBSD,
Mac OS X, and Solaris.
