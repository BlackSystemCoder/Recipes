[Description] djbdns is a compact, highly-secure DNS server suite,
that includes the following two programs:

* djbdns  (WARNING - not tested on Gobo!)
* tinydns

The djbdns program is a recursive, resolving DNS server.  You use
djbdns to look up DNS info for domains and cache it locally on your
network.  WARNING: djbdns as compiled by this recipe has not been
tested.  I know of at least one location in the source code where a
hardcoded '/etc' path probably needs to be patched.

The tinydns program is a master DNS server.  You use tinydns to
publish authoritative DNS information your own domains.
