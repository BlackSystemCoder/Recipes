[Name] Convmv
[Summary] Converts file and directory names from one encoding to another.
[Description] Convmv is meant to help convert a single filename, a directory 
tree and the contained files or a whole filesystem into a different encoding. 
It just converts the filenames, not the content of the files. A special 
feature of convmv is that it also takes care of symlinks, also converts 
the symlink target pointer in case the symlink target is being converted, 
too.
