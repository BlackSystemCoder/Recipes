[Name] Lemon
[Summary] The Lemon program is an LALR(1) parser generator.
[Description] The Lemon program is an LALR(1) parser generator. It takes a 
context free grammar and converts it into a subroutine that will parse a 
file using that grammar. Lemon is similar to the much more famous programs 
"YACC" and "BISON". But lemon is not compatible with either yacc or bison.
