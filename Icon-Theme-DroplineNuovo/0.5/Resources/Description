Icon-Theme-DroplineNuovo

[Summary]
Any icon theme by silvestre.

[Description]
In the authors words:

Dropline Nuovo! is the most complete theme that ive made (at least 
the unreleased version i have here is). Unlike Neu!, Nuovo! makes 
less use of perspective (barely uses perspective) and has a 
desaturated color pallete. This was intended to be a more-sober 
icon set, but is just as friendly as any of the other icon sets.
