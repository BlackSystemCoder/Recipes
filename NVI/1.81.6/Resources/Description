[Description] Nvi is an implementation of the ex/vi text editor originally

- Colon command-line editing and path name completion
- Tag stacks (including support for Cscope databases)
- Extended Regular Expressions
- Infinite undo
- Horizontal scrolling
- Message catalogs (Dutch, English, French, German, Russian, Spanish, Swedish)
- Preliminary support for Perl and Tcl/Tk scripting languages
