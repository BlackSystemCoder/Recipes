[Description]
Deluge is a bittorrent client for Linux and other Unix-Like operating systems. 
Deluge was created because of the lack of a good, native, GTK based torrent 
solution for Linux. Deluge is among the most feature-rich clients in development
second only to Azureus, but without the bloat, and ahead of µTorrent. Deluge was
created with the intention of being lightweight and unobtrusive.

Deluge supports the following network features: Mainline DHT, FAST protocol
extension, uTorrent Peer Exchange, BitTorrent Protocol Encryption, UPnP and NAT-
PMP, Proxy support for Peers, Tracker, DHT, and Web-Seed, and Private Torrents.

In addition, Deluge has the following features available: Able to download multi-
ple files in a single window, Full preallocation and compact allocation, Global 
and per-torrent speed limits, Ability to select files from a torrent before 
beginning the download, Option to prioritize the first and last pieces of a file,
in order to allow for media previews, Ability to specify global download 
directory, and a completed download directory, Queuing system to better manage 
bandwidth between downloads, Ability to stop uploading a torrent once it has 
reached a specified ratio, Ability to minimize to the system tray, and optionally
password protect the tray.

Deluge supports a rich plugin system, and several plugins are included with 
Deluge, including: Blocklist Importer, Desired Ratio, Network Activity Graph, 
Network Health Monitor, RSS Broadcatcher, Torrent Creator, Torrent Notification,
