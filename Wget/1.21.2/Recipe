# Wget needs GnuTLS >= 3.7.0 during compilation to work fine with
# Nettle 3.7.3. But GnuTLS 3.7.0 requires Nettle >= 3.6 to build.
# While updgrading GnuTLS, Compile's wget request would break even if
# we Symlink the old nettle, because Runner woulde explicitly Symlink
# new Nettle during Compile.
# I have found this hassle can be worked around by compiling wget with
# OpenSSL support.
