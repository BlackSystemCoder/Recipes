[Description]This applet monitors various temperature, frequency and fan sources in your kicker panel.Make sure you have enabled a supported kernel module.
Features:
=========
supported thermal sources:
- the Linux ACPI Thermal Zone driver. The corresponding kernel module is called thermal.
- the thermal sources of the Linux ACPI driver for the IBM ThinkPad laptops. The corresponding kernel module is called ibm-acpi.
- the IBM Hard Drive Active Protection System (HDAPS) driver. The corresponding kernel module is called hdaps.
- the Omnibook Configuration Tools & Patches. The corresponding kernel module is called omnibook.
- the iBook G4 CPU and GPU thermal zones. It may work on other Apple machines as well (please let me know).
- the thermal sensors available through hwmon (I2C, lm_sensors, ...).
- the CPU thermal sensor of the i8k kernel driver for Dell Inspiron and Latitude notebooks.
- the GPU thermal sensors of nvidia-settings (provided by the nVidia GPU card driver tools)

supported frequency sources:
- the Linux kernel /proc/cpuinfo interface
- the Linux kernel cpufreq subsystem

supported fan sources:
- the fan sensors available through hwmon (I2C, lm_sensors, ...).
- the fan sources of the Linux ACPI driver for the IBM ThinkPad laptops. The corresponding kernel module is called ibm-acpi.
- the fan sources of the i8k kernel driver for Dell Inspiron and Latitude notebooks.

cpufreqd control module to switch cpufreqd profiles via cpufreqd remote interface
