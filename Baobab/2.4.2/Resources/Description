Baobab is able to scan either specific directories or the whole         
filesystem, in order to give the user a graphical tree representation                                  
including each directory size or percentage in the branch.     
It also includes a complete file-search functionality and auto-detects                               
in real-time any changes made to your home directory as far as any
mounted/unmounted device.
