[Name] Pinentry
[Summary] Presents password dialogs in a secure way
[License] GNU General Public License (GPL)
[Description] This package contains a program that allows for secure \
entry of PINs or pass phrases. That means it tries to take care that \
the entered information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored \
anywhere. This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass \
phrases when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients \
using the same. It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to \
particular software.
