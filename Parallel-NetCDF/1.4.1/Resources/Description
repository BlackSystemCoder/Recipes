[Name] Parallel-NetCDF
[Summary] A Parallel I/O Library for NetCDF File Access
[Description] PnetCDF is a library providing high-performance I/O while still maintaining file-format compatibility with  Unidata's NetCDF. NetCDF gives scientific programmers a self-describing and portable means for storing data. However, prior to version 4, netCDF does so in a serial manner. By making some small changes to the netCDF APIs, PnetCDF can use MPI-IO to achieve high-performance parallel I/O.
