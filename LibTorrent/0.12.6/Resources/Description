[Description] LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for \
*nix, with a focus on high performance and good code. The library \
differentiates itself from other implementations by transfering \
directly from file pages to the network stack. On high-bandwidth \
connections it is able to seed at 3 times the speed of the official \
client.
