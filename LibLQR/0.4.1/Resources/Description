[Summary] A C/C++ API for performing non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
[Description] The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing
non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.
The library takes images in plain array format as input
and converts them to a multi-size representation.
Following is a list of features:
  * Easy to use and fully documented API
  * Currently supports 8 bit to 64 bit per channel images
  * Support for different color models: grayscale, RGB, CMY
    and their variants, and even custom ones
  * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or
    discard, or for additional seam rigidity
  * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can
    be done in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved
    and read out later without any further processing
  * The resizing is done with a single function which
    automatically performs all the necessary operations; it
    can also work in successive steps without wasting
    computational time
  * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the
    seams be less connected, or more rigid, or both (the
    rigidity can be also be modulated through a mask, to get
    a differnet behaviour in different areas of the image)
  * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)
  * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving
    process as the parent image 
  * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned
    by selecting among different energy gradient functions,
    and easily defining custom ones
  * Reports progress through a customisable interface
  * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors
  * Portable to all major OS's
