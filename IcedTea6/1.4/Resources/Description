[Name] IcedTea6
[Summary] The IcedTea project provides a harness to build the source code from
openjdk.java.net using Free Software tools and dependencies
[Description] IcedTea addresses two problems: it eliminates the build requirement on
proprietary build tools and it provides replacements for the
"encumbered binary plugs".
This project uses code from GNU Classpath, code generated during a
build of the openjdk.java.net source code, and stub code written by
Red Hat, to provide Free Software replacements for these encumbered
binary plugs.
IcedTea also provides build scripts and patches that allow the source
code from openjdk.java.net to be built with IcedTea itself.
