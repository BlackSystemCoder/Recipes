[Name] ConnMan
[Summary] Lightweight network connection manager.
[Description] The Connection Manager (ConnMan) project provides a daemon for managing internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux operating system. ConnMan is designed to be slim and to use as few resources as possible, so it can be easily integrated. It is a fully modular system that can be extended, through plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or wireless technologies. Also, configuration methods, like DHCP and domain name resolving, are implemented using plug-ins. The plug-in approach allows for easy adaption and modification for various use cases.
