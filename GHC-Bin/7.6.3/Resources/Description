[Description] The Glasgow Haskell Compiler is a robust, fully-featured, optimising compiler for the functional programming language Haskell. GHC compiles Haskell to either native code or C. It implements numerous experimental language extensions to Haskell for example concurrency, a foreign language interface, several type-system extensions, exceptions, and so on. GHC comes with a generational garbage collector, a space and time profiler, and a comprehensive set of libraries.
